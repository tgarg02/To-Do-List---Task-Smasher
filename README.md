A CRUD To-Do List app built using SQLAlchemy, Python, Flask, HTML, and CSS is a simple web application that allows users to:

Create new to-do tasks,

Read (view) a list of existing tasks,

Update tasks and

Delete tasks.

**Key Components:**
Flask: Serves as the web framework to handle routing and requests.

SQLAlchemy: Manages the database (usually SQLite), handling task creation, updates, and queries.

HTML/CSS: Used to build and style the front-end interface where users interact with the task list.

**Basic Workflow:**
The app defines a Task model in SQLAlchemy.

Users interact with forms on web pages (HTML) to add or modify tasks.

Flask routes process the form submissions and use SQLAlchemy to update the database.

CSS styles the layout to improve user experience.
